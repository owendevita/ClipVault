# ClipVault

## ABOUT

Clipboard security is becoming more important as malware strains have begun specifically targeting the insecure integrated system clipboards. As more users begin utilizing password managers and cryptocurrency wallets, our system clipboards are privy to more sensitive information than ever before. ClipVault is a proposed solution to this problem — a clipboard program that will replace the Windows or Linux integrated clipboard and provide encryption and transparency. ClipVault will not only encrypt all data at rest and in transit while copying and pasting, but it will also provide users notifications when their clipboard is read and modified. This helps prevent attacks that modify the user’s clipboard without their knowledge. ClipVault will also include a user-friendly interface to make configuration changes and a clipboard history if desired.
